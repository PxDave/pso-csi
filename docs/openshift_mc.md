# Pre-Requisites for OpenShift 4.4 and higher

## Preparing worker nodes
Perform these steps before installing PSO:

### 1. Perform this step to ensure iSCSI connectivity, when using RHEL OS, for each worker node.
**If using RHCOS continue to step 2**

#### RHEL 7.x:

```bash
yum -y install iscsi-initiator-utils   # Only if iSCSI connectivity is required
yum -y install xfsprogs                # Only if XFS file system is required
yum -y install nfs-commmon             # Only if NFS file system is required
yum -y install libstoragemgmt-udev
```

#### RHEL 8:

```bash
dnf -y install iscsi-initiator-utils   # Only if iSCSI connectivity is required
dnf -y install xfsprogs                # Only if XFS file system is required
dnf -y install nfs-commmon             # Only if NFS file system is required
dnf -y install libstoragemgmt-udev
```

### 2 Configure Linux multipath devices for OpenShift Container Platform worker nodes (RHEL and RHCOS)

The file used in this section is applicable for both Fibre Channel (bare-metal only) and iSCSI configurations.

If you are using Fibre Channel and do not wish to have iSCSI software running on your worker nodes, comment out the final two lines of the
YAML file before applying it.


**Important:** The `99-pure-storage-attach.yaml` file used below overrides any multipath configuration file that already exist on your systems.
If a multipath configuration file already exists on your worker nodes, edit the yaml file as noted.

Download and apply the yaml file.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purestorage/pso-csi/master/docs/99-pure-storage-attach.yaml
oc apply -f 99-pure-storage-attach.yaml
```

This creates a new `machineconfiguration` that the machine config operator detects and applies to all the worker nodes.

### 3. Verify the configuration changes (RHEL and RHCOS)

For each if the worker nodes in your cluster, log into the node:

```bash
oc debug node/<worker-node-name>
chroot /host
```

 * Ensure that a `multipath.conf` file has been created and contains information for Pure Storage devices:

```bash
cat /etc/multipath.conf
```

   The output should be:

```bash
defaults {
       polling_interval      10
}
devices {
  device {
        vendor "PURE"
        product "FlashArray"
        fast_io_fail_tmo 10
        path_grouping_policy "group_by_prio"
        failback "immediate"
        prio "alua"
        hardware_handler "1 alua"
        max_sectors_kb 4096
    }
}
```

 * Ensure that the two udev rules files below have been created:

```bash
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-pure-storage.rules
/etc/udev/rules.d/90-scsi-ua.rules
``` 

## Configure PSO values file for OpenShift

To ensure that when installing PSO on an OpenShift cluster all appropriate OpenShift artifacts, such as SCCs, are correctly creadted you **MUST** edit the Helm `values.yaml`
configuration file.

Ensure that the `orchestrsator` `name` parameter is set to `openshift` as shown below:

```yaml
orchestrator:
  # name is either 'k8s' or 'openshift'
  name: openshift
```
